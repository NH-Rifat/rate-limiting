3. ✅ Redundant documentation in code
4. ✅ Unnecessary whitespace and formatting
5. ✅ Overly detailed explanations

## What Was Preserved
1. ✅ All core functionality
2. ✅ Essential error handling
3. ✅ Rate limiting logic for both algorithms
4. ✅ All API endpoints
5. ✅ Test coverage
6. ✅ Documentation in docs/ folder

## Verification
Run these commands to verify everything works:
```bash
npm run demo          # Test comparison demo
npm start             # Start Fixed Window server (port 3000)
npm run start:token   # Start Token Bucket server (port 3001)
npm test              # Run all tests
```

## Code Quality
- ✅ Clean, readable code
- ✅ Professional structure
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ No unnecessary verbosity
- ✅ Maintained folder organization
